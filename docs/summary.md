# Project Summary

Customizable portfolio pages; gated downloads; subscription tiers; Stripe integration; analytics dashboard; responsive design; SEO-friendly structure; and an API for programmatic uploads. Faster setup than general-purpose site builders, opinionated defaults that look great out-of-the-box, and a focus on creator monetization rather than generic CMS features. Independent creators, designers, photographers, and small studios who want a fast, beautiful site with minimal setup and built-in monetization.
